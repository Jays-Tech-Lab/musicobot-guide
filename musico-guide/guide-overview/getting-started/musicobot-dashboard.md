Now you will get the option to setup Musico in one of your servers or view the dashboard for servers that already have the bot.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Essentially _**"Setup"**_ means it is not on that server and selecting it will invite MusicoBot to your server. However if the bot is already in your server you will see _**"Dashboard"**_ option instead of _**"Setup"**_
{% endhint %}

Lets say you have MusicoBot in your server, now its time to configure some settings in the Dashboard!&#x20;
